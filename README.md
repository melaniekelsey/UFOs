# UFO Analysis & Website Update
## Overview of the Project
I was tasked with making some minor changes to our UFO Finder website. Ultimately, we wanted to make a better user experience for the end users. Previously, they were able to filter the UFO sighting data solely by date of sighting. I was tasked with offering up some additional filter choices to assist the end user in filtering down to the exact data they wished to view with a few keystrokes. 

## Results

### How to navigate your new improved website
I am going to walk you through the process of adding filters to the UFO Sightings table. 

Here is a view of the unfiltered table. As you can see, there are some sample formats of how the end user would enter each filter field.

As mentioned above, in addition to the Date filter, I have added four additional filter options of City, State, Country and Shape. This allows the end user to zero in on specific UFO Sightings easily. 

Here is how to easily filter the data. The end user can choose what filters they would like to use by simply inputting their desired fields and pressing the enter button. 

Here is an example of the date filter. I simply typed in 1/1/2010 into the date field. This is virtually the same process as our website's first iteration with the filter button removed.

Adding "el cajon" to the city filter and pressing the enter key allowed the end user to filter down to 4 different UFO sightings in El Cajon on that date.

If the end user wanted to drill down even more, they could type "triangle" in the shape field and see specifically the 2 triangle shaped UFO sightings on that date.

To clear the filters, the end user can erase the inputs that they added or click the UFO Sightings in the upper left hand corner in the Navigation Pane and it will reset the filters back to unfiltered. 

## Summary
In summary, I believe the changes made to the website make it easier to filter and drill down to the data that the end user wants to access. In a quick few keystrokes, end users are able to access UFO sighting info by date, city, state, country and shape. This has created a user experience that is very intuitive and efficient. 

### Drawbacks
I believe that there are a few drawbacks to this format. Since the data is entered by the end user, it's hard to capture incorrectly formatted inputs. If they enter the date in the wrong format no results will be displayed. 

#### Input formatting issues

If they enter the city with capitalization, the data will not display. For example, Benton and benton entered into the city filter offer different results.

#### Lack of ease in resetting your filters

Though I believe that this website it very useful, it's not clear to the end user how to reset filters in the case that they want to do multiple searches. Though we both know that clicking on the UFO Sightings on the Navigation Pane resets the filters, it's not clear to the end user. 

### Recommendations on future improvements to the site
I think that we can make this website even more useful and clear cut to use with some minor improvements. 

#### Clear Filter Button
I believe it would be useful to create a clear filter button in the Filter Search Pane. This would offer the end user a one click solution to reset the filters and allow them to continue to utilize the tables easily. 

#### Clarity around end user input formats
It would be very useful for the end user to have clear cut instructions on date formatting and even capitalization while inputting their filters. Better yet, it might be useful to have some sort of error message that displays if they enter dates in the wrong format. 

#### Dropdown filter rather than user input
I think it would be useful to alter the filters to be dropdown choices rather than user input. It would eliminate incorrectly formatted dates or incorrectly spelled text. It would allow the end user to scroll through the choices and select the field they want to view. 

In conclusion, I think we are off to a great start and we can only go up from here. Hopefully, not in an alien spaceship.
